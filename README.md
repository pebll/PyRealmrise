## PyRealmrise 
Realmrise is a bigger and way more ambitious project I plan to begin on day.
It will be a ~4X Strategy game with heavy focus on "simple but hard to master", multiplayer, tactis and grand strategy, trading and diplomacy

## This project
This project is a prototype of the ressource gathering and city expansion system.
It takes place on a square grid in the terminal, and AIs with _different_ (not quite implemented) strategies can start collecting resources and expand their city.
We can tweak the simuation (the map generation) for testing purposes and visualize the results in the terminal (actual colored map) and on plots for performance.

## Future work
- Implement starting city placement choice to AIs to avoid getting stuck to much
- Change the grid to hex-based
- Improve the AI
